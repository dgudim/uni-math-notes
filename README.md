# Obsidian math notes

These are my discrete math notes exported from obsidian + source .md files

You can explore the vault by

1. Installing [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
2. Installing [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) for graph support in notes
3. Downloading the [repository](https://github.com/dgudim/uni-math-notes/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
4. Extracting it and opening `source` folder as an obsidian vault
